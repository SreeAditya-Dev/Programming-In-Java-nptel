- No specific hardware restrictions; most modern computers will suffice.

### Obtaining Java Software
- All essential Java tools (mainly the JDK) are free to use and download from the internet.
- The primary source for JDK is the official Java website (historically JavaSoft or sun.java.com).
- Use search engines (e.g., Google, with search terms like "JDK download") to find the latest JDK.

### JDK Versions
- JDK stands for Java Development Kit: the key software bundle for Java developers.
- Multiple versions are available; for beginners, JDK version 8 is recommended due to its maturity, versatility, and ease of use.
- Avoid SDK (Software Development Kit) unless advanced features are specifically needed as it may add unnecessary complexity and slow down the system.
- Recent versions up to JDK 11 exist but may not be necessary for entry-level programming tasks.

### Installation Process
- Download JDK 8 from official or reputable sources.
- Follow on-screen installation instructions specific to your OS (Windows, MacOS, or Solaris).

## Java Application Programming Interface (API) Packages

Java APIs are comprehensive standard libraries packaged as modular units, each specializing in a task.

### Structure and Significance of APIs
- APIs are grouped into packages, each consisting of classes and functions relevant to a particular programming domain.
- APIs extend core language functionality, allowing programmers to focus on application logic instead of low-level details.
- There are nine core packages most developers encounter, categorized as follows:

#### Overview Table of Core Java Packages

| Package Name      | Typical Purpose                                         |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| java.applet       | Applet programming (usually GUIs in browsers)          |
| java.awt          | Abstract Window Toolkit, supporting GUI building        |
| java.io           | Input/output operations, handling files, streams, etc. |
| java.lang         | Fundamental classes (String, Math, Object)â€”auto-import |
| java.net          | Network programming, sockets, protocols, etc.          |
| java.util         | Utility/data structures (collections, dates, random)   |

## Third-Party Tools and Browsers for Java Programming

### Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)
- **IDEs** streamline the creation, testing, and debugging of Java applications by providing graphical tools and integration of core commands.
- Many are commercial; some provide free (limited-feature) versions.

| IDE Name              | Provider             | Features                                  | Free?
|-----------------------|----------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----|
| Sun's Java Workshop   | Sun Microsystems     | User-friendly, comprehensive              | No  |
| Mojo                  | Penumbra Software    | Applet creation focused                   | No  |
| Jumba                 | Aimtech and IBM      | Applet programming                        | No  |
| Symantec Cafe         | Symantec             | All-in-one, advanced debugging/testing     | No (costly for individuals)
| NetBeans              | Oracle               | Modern IDE for large projects             | Partially (limited free version)
| Notepad++             | Third-party          | Advanced text/code editor                  | Yes |

- **NetBeans**
  - Widely used, supports large-scale projects.
  - Some features are paid, but basic use is free.

- **Notepad++**
  - Feature-rich free code editor.
  - Highly recommended for writing and editing Java code fast and efficiently.
  - Can be set as the default editor.

### Browsers for Applet and Java Program Viewing
- Java was designed for web programming. Traditionally, browsers such as Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, and HotJava supported Java applets directly.
- Due to security issues, most modern browsers have stopped Java applet support.
- Appletviewer from the JDK is now primarily used for learning and testing applets.
- HotJava and Netscape Navigator can still run some Java applets in specific environments, but their usage is rare.
- Deployment of Java programs on the web now uses different approaches, as will be covered in later lessons.

## Subsets of the Java Language: Fundamental Elements

This section describes crucial elements every Java programmer needs to understand and master at the language level.

### Built-in (Primitive) Data Types
- Java provides several primitive (or built-in) data types, similar to C and C++:

| Data Type | Storage Size (bits) | Typical Use                  |
|-----------|---------------------|------------------------------|
| boolean   | 1                   | true/false values            |
| byte      | 8                   | small integer values         |
| char      | 16                  | single characters            |
| short     | 16                  | short integers               |
| int       | 32                  | standard integers            |
| long      | 64                  | long integers                |
| float     | 32                  | single-precision decimals    |
| double    | 64                  | double-precision decimals    |

- These data types are directly understood by the compiler and enable basic operations.

### Reference Data Types
- Enable definition and use of programmer-defined data structures.
- Includes objects (instances of classes), arrays, and interfaces.
- Also known as abstract data types or custom data types.
- Enables the power and flexibility of object-oriented programming.

### Java Character Set and Identifiers

#### Character Set
- Valid characters for Java programming are:
  - Uppercase letters: Aâ€“Z
  - Lowercase letters: aâ€“z
  - Digits: 0â€“9
  - Special characters: _ (underscore), $ (dollar), etc. (case-specific, refer to documentation for full list).
- Invalid characters in code (unsupported symbols or whitespace inside identifiers) result in compilation errors.

#### Naming Rules for Identifiers
- Identifiers include variable names, class names, method names, etc.
- Rules:
  - Letters, digits, or underscores only; no spaces or commas.
  - First character must be a letter or an underscore (not a digit).
  - Names can be of any length (practicality and readability are advised).
  - Java is case-sensitive: `MyVar` and `myvar` are different.

#### Example
```java
int a, b;
b = 0;
System.out.println("Sum is: " + (a + b));
```

### Working with Arrays in Java

Arrays are a critical structure for storing multiple values of the same type efficiently.

#### Declaring Arrays
- One-dimensional array template:
```java
int x[];            // or
int[] x;
```
- Allocating memory:
```java
x = new int[100];   // reserves space for 100 integers
```
- Shorthand (declaration + allocation):
```java
int x[] = new int[100];
```
- Initialization at declaration:
```java
int x[] = {12, 13, 9, 15};   // x[0]=12, x[1]=13, etc.
```
- Arrays are zero-indexed (first element at index 0).

#### Two-dimensional Arrays
- Declaration and allocation:
```java
int myArray[][] = new int[3][4];   // 3 rows, 4 columns
```
- Initialization (explicit):
```java
int myArray[][] = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
```
- Using loops for initialization is recommended for larger arrays.
- Java supports variable-length (jagged) arrays:
```java
int jaggedArray[][] = new int[3][];
jaggedArray[0] = new int[2];  // row 1 with 2 columns
jaggedArray[1] = new int[4];  // row 2 with 4 columns
jaggedArray[2] = new int[3];  // row 3 with 3 columns
```

#### Three-dimensional Arrays
- Declaration:
```java
int threeD[][][] = new int[2][3][4];
```
- Useful for representing complex data like 3D matrices or multiple tables.
- Access involves three indices (i, j, k).
- Initialization again typically uses nested loops.

#### Common Array Operations
- Traversing: using loops to access elements
- Searching: looking for a value
- Sorting: arranging elements in order
- Insertion/Deletion: adding or removing elements (requires shifting in arrays)

### Additional Language Features (Preview)
- Java supports recursive functions (methods calling themselves), similar to C/C++.
- Input/output (I/O) operations are thoroughly supported via java.io and java.util packages.
- Further topics like applets, advanced GUIs, networking, database connectivity, and more will be elaborated in future studies.
